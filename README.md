# Stripboard
Stripboard Editor, for designing small projects on copper stripboard.  Does not provide a schematic editor, you place components directly.  Has a small library of basic stuff.  It's all client side, everything's saved in browser storage

Currently uses a canvas object and the 2d graphics context, which is really inefficient.  I might switch it to webgl at some point
